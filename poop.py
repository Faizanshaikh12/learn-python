# ABSTRACT CLASSES üëª
# Prevents a user from creating an object of that class
# Compels a user to override abstract methods in a child class
# abstract class = a class which contains one or more abstract methods.
# abstract method = a method that has a declaration but does not have an implementation.

# DUCK TYPING ü¶Ü

# WALRUS OPERATOR ü¶¶
# new to python 3.8
# assignment expression aka walrus operator
# assigns values to variable as part of a larger expression

# ZIP FUNCTION ü§ê (*iterables)
# aggregate elements from two or more iterables (list, tuples, sets etc.)
# creates a zip object with paired elemetns stored in tuples for each elements.
