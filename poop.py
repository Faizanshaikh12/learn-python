# ABSTRACT CLASSES üëª
# Prevents a user from creating an object of that class
# Compels a user to override abstract methods in a child class
# abstract class = a class which contains one or more abstract methods.
# abstract method = a method that has a declaration but does not have an implementation.

# WALRUS OPERATOR ü¶¶
# new to python 3.8
# assignment expression aka walrus operator
# assigns values to variable as part of a larger expression

# happy = True

# while True:

# ZIP FUNCTION ü§ê (*iterables)
# aggregate elements from two or more iterables (list, tuples, sets etc.)
# creates a zip object with paired elemetns stored in tuples for each elements.

# passwords = ["Password", "Admin123", "guest"]

# for i in users:

# if _name_ == '__main__' ‚ùì
# 1. Module can be run as a standalone program

# Python interpreter sets "special variables", one of which is __name__

# TIME MODULE ‚åö
# import time

# THREADING üßµ
# thread = a flow of execution. like a separate order of instructions
# However each thread takes a turn running to achieve concurrency
# GIL = global interpreter lock.
# allow only one thread to hold the control of the python interpreter

# cpu bound = program/task spends most of it's time waiting for internal events
# io bound  = program/task spends most of it's time waiting for external events

# DAEMON THREADS üòà
# a thread that runs in the background, not importent for program to run
# you program will not wait for demon threads to complete before existing
# non-demon cannot normally be killed, stay alive until task is complete
# ex. background tasks, garbage collection, waiting for input, long running process.

# MULTIPROCESSING ‚ö°
# Running tasks in parallel on diffrent cpu cores, bypasses GIL used for threading
# multiprocessing = better for cpu bound tasks (heavy cpu usages)
# multithreading = better for io bound tasks (waiting bound)
# from multiprocessing import Process, cpu_count

# def counter(num):
#     count = 0
#     while count < num:
